# Chess application

 University project done during the PROP subject in FIB, UPC. 2018-2019
 
That year, the subject consisted in creating a desktop chess application in a three group with its own interface and IA using the Java programming language. It was a great effort to program the AI using Minimax algorithm and other stuff.

We wrote a document explaining the Java classes that we used and the IA algorithm, and other document as manual to know how to use the desktop application. You can see them in the following links:
